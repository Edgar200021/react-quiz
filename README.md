# React Quiz

React Quiz is a project built using React that allows users to test their knowledge of React concepts. It consists of a series of questions related to React, where users need to select the correct answer within a given time limit. The application utilizes the `useReducer` hook for managing state.

## Features

- Single-choice questions: The quiz presents users with a set of questions, each having only one correct answer. Users need to select the correct answer from the available choices.
- Timer: A countdown timer is displayed for the entire quiz, providing a time limit for answering all the questions.
- Score tracking: The application keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz, incrementing it for each correct answer.
- Results: The final results page displays the total score achieved by the user.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `useReducer` hook: A built-in React hook that provides state management capabilities. It is used to manage the state of the quiz, track user answers, calculate the score, and handle the timer for the entire quiz.
